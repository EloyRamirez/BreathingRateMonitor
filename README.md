# BreathingRateMonitor
Final project for Digital Signals Processing class.

Created a breathing rate monitor using an Arduino Uno and a temperature sensor. Implemented analog-to-digital signal conversion with noise reduction and filtering.
Designed the system to emit warning tones based on varying BPM (breaths per minute) ranges, utilizing MATLAB for comprehensive analysis of time domain and frequency spectra.
